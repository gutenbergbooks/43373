  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-m.png" width="142" height="142" alt="M"/>
</div>

<div class="drop-cap">MY soul vibrated for a
moment like a harp.
Was it true? The
night, the long night
of the world's groping agony
and blind desire? <i>Is</i> it almost
over? <i>Is</i> the day at hand?</div>

<p>Again: "<span class="smcap">They shall see the
Son of man coming in a cloud,
with power and great glory.</span>
<i>And when these things come to pass,
look up and rejoice, for your redemption
is nigh.</i>"</p>

<p>Coming!&mdash;The Son of man
really coming into <i>this</i> world
again with power and great
glory?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Will this really ever happen?
Will this solid, commonplace
earth see it? Will these skies
brighten and flash? and will upturned
faces in this city be watching
to see Him coming?</p>

<p>So our minister preached in a
solemn sermon; and for moments,
at times, I felt a thrill of
reality in hearing. But as the
well-dressed crowd passed down
the aisle, my neighbor, Mr.
Stockton, whispered to me not
to forget the meeting of the bank
directors on Monday evening,
and Mrs. Goldthwaite poured
into my wife's ear a charge not
to forget her party on Thursday;
and my wife, as she came
out, asked me if I had observed
the extravagant toilet of Mrs.
Rennyman.</p>

<p>"<i>So</i> absurd," she said, "when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
her income, I know, cannot be
half what ours is! and I <i>never</i>
think of sending to Paris for my
things; I should look on it as
morally wrong."</p>

<p>I spoke of the sermon. "Yes,"
said my wife, "what a sermon!&mdash;so
solemn. I wonder that all
are not drawn to hear our rector.
What could be more powerful
than such discourses? My dear,
by the by, <i>don't</i> forget to change
Mary's opal ring for a diamond
one. Dear me! the Christmas
presents were all so on my mind
that I was thinking of them every
now and then in church; and
that was <i>so</i> wrong of me!"</p>

<p>"My dear," said I, "sometimes
it seems to me as if all
our life were unreal. We go to
church, and the things that
we hear are either true or false.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
If they are true, what things
they are! For instance, these
Advent sermons. If we are
looking for <i>that</i> coming, we
ought to feel and live differently
from what we do! Do we really
believe what we hear in church?
or is it a dream?"</p>

<p>"I <i>do</i> believe," said my wife
earnestly&mdash;she is a good woman,
my wife&mdash;"yes, I <i>do</i> believe, but
it is just as you say. Oh, dear!
I feel as if I am very worldly&mdash;I
have so many things to think
of!" and she sighed.</p>

<p>So do I; for I knew that I, too,
was very worldly. After a pause
I said: "Suppose Christ should
really come this Christmas and
it should be authoritatively announced
that He would be here
to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"I think," said my wife, "there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
would be some embarrassment
on the part of our great men,
legislators, and chief councilors,
in anticipation of a personal interview.
Fancy a meeting of the
city council to arrange a reception
for the Lord Jesus Christ!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said I, "He would
refuse all offers of the rich and
great. Perhaps our fashionable
churches would plead for His
presence in vain. He would not
be in palaces."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said my wife earnestly,
"if I thought our money separated
us from Him, I would give
it <i>all</i>&mdash;yes, <i>all</i>&mdash;might I only
see Him."</p>

<p>She spoke from the bottom of
her heart, and for a moment her
face was glorified.</p>

<p>"You <i>will</i> see Him some day,"
said I, "and the money we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
willing to give up at a word from
Him will not keep Him from us."</p>

<p>That evening the thoughts of
the waking hours mirrored themselves
in a dream.</p>

<p>I seemed to be out walking in
the streets, and to be conscious
of a strange, vague sense of
<i>something</i> just declared, of which
all were speaking with a suppressed
air of mysterious voices.</p>

<p>There was a whispering stillness
around. Groups of men
stood at the corners of the street,
and discussed an impending something
with suppressed voices.</p>

<p>I heard one say to another:
"<i>Really</i> coming! What? to-morrow?"
And the others said:
"Yes, to-morrow; on Christmas
Day He will be here."</p>

<p>It was night. The stars were
glittering with a keen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
frosty light; the shops glistened
in their Christmas array; but
the same sense of hushed expectancy
pervaded every thing.
There seemed to be nothing doing;
and each person looked wistfully
upon his neighbor as if to
say, Have you heard?</p>

<p>Suddenly, as I walked, an
angel-form was with me, gliding
softly by my side. The face was
solemn, serene, and calm. Above
the forehead was a pale, tremulous,
phosphorous, radiance of
light, purer than any on earth&mdash;a
light of a quality so different
from that of the street-lamps,
that my celestial attendant
seemed to move in a sphere alone.</p>

<p>Yet, though I felt awe, I felt
a sort of confiding love as I said:
"Tell me, is it really true?
<i>Is</i> Christ coming?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">He is</span>," said the angel. "To-morrow
He will be here!"</p>

<p>"What joy!" I cried.</p>

<p>"Is it joy?" said the angel.
"Alas, to many in this city it is
only terror! Come with me."</p>

<p>In a moment I seemed to be
standing with him in a parlor
of one of the chief palaces of the
city. A stout, florid, bald-headed
man was seated at a table covered
with papers, which he was
sorting over with nervous anxiety,
muttering to himself as he
did so. On a sofa lay a sad-looking,
delicate woman, her
emaciated hands clasped over a
little book. The room was, in
all its appointments, a witness
of boundless wealth. Gold and
silver, and gems, and foreign
furniture, and costly pictures,
and articles of <i>virtu</i>&mdash;everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
that money could buy&mdash;were
heaped together; and yet the
man himself seemed to me to
have been neither elevated nor
refined by the confluence of all
these treasures. He seemed
nervous and uneasy. He wiped
the sweat from his brow, and
spoke:</p>

<p>"I don't know, wife, how <i>you</i>
feel; but <i>I</i> don't like this news.
I don't understand it. It puts a
stop to everything <i>I</i> know anything
about."</p>

<p>"Oh, John!" said the woman,
turning towards him a face pale
and fervent, and clasping her
hands, "how can you say so?"</p>

<p>And as she spoke, I could see
breaking out above her head a
tremulous light, like that above
the brow of an angel.</p>

<p>"Well, Mary, it's the truth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
I don't care if I say it. I don't
want to meet&mdash;well I wish He
would put it off! What does He
want of me? I'd be willing to
make over&mdash;well, three millions
to found an hospital, if He'd be
satisfied and let me go on. Yes,
I'd give three millions&mdash;to buy
off from to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Is He not our best friend?"</p>

<p>"Best friend!" said the man,
with a look half fright, half
anger. "Mary, you don't know
what you are talking about!
You know I always hated those
things. There's no use in it; I
can't see into them. In fact, I
<i>hate</i> them."</p>

<p>She cast on him a look full of
pity. "<i>Cannot</i> I make you see?"
she said.</p>

<p>"No, indeed, you can't. Why,
look here," he added, pointing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to the papers. "Here is what
stands for millions! To-night
it's mine; and to-morrow it will
be all so much waste paper; and
then what have I left? Do you
think I can rejoice? I'd give
half; I'd give&mdash;yes, <i>the whole</i>,
not to have Him come these
hundred years." She stretched
out her thin hand towards him;
but he pushed it back.</p>

<p>"Do you see?" said the angel
to me solemnly. "Between him
and her there is a "<span class="small">GREAT GULF</span>
<i>fixed</i>." They have lived in one
house with that gulf between
them for years! She cannot go
to him; he cannot go to her.
To-morrow she will rise to
Christ as a dewdrop to the sun;
and he will call to the mountains
and rocks to fall on him&mdash;not
because Christ hates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
<i>him</i>, but because <i>he</i> hates
Christ."</p>

<p>Again the scene was changed.
We stood together in a little low
attic, lighted by one small lamp&mdash;how
poor it was!&mdash;a broken
chair, a rickety table, a bed in
the corner where the little ones
were cuddling close to one another
for warmth. Poor things!
the air was so frosty that their
breath congealed upon the bedclothes,
as they talked in soft,
baby voices. "When mother
comes, she will bring us some
supper," said they. "But I'm so
cold!" said the little outsider.
"Get in the middle, then," said
the other two, "and we'll warm
you. Mother promised she would
make a fire when she came in,
if that man would pay her."
"What a bad man he is!" said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the oldest boy; "he never pays
mother if he can help it."</p>

<p>Just then the door opened, and
a pale, thin woman came in,
laden with packages.</p>

<p>She laid all down, and came
to her children's bed, clasping
her hands in rapture.</p>

<p>"Joy, joy, children! Oh, joy,
joy! Christ is coming! He will
be here to-morrow."</p>

<p>Every little bird in the nest was
up, and the little arms around
the mother's neck; the children
believed at once. They had
heard of the good Jesus. He had
been their mother's only friend
through many a cold and hungry
day, and they doubted not He
was coming.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother! will He take
us? He will, won't He?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my little ones," she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
said softly, smiling to herself;
"He shall gather the lambs with
His arms, and carry them in
His bosom."</p>

<p>Suddenly again, as by the
slide of a magic lantern, another
scene was present.</p>

<p>We stood in a lonely room,
where a woman was sitting with
her head bowed forward upon her
hands. Alone, forsaken, slandered,
she was in bitterness of spirit.
Hard, cruel tongues had spoken
her name with vile assertions,
and a thoughtless world had believed.
There had been a babble
of accusations, a crowd to rejoice
in iniquity, and few to pity.
She thought herself alone, and
she spoke: "Judge me, O Lord!
for I have walked in my integrity.
I am as a monster unto many;
but thou art my strong refuge."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>In a moment the angel touched
her. "My sister," he said, "be
of good cheer. Christ will be
here <i>to-morrow</i>."</p>

<p>She started up, with her hands
clasped, her eyes bright, her
whole form dilated, as she seemed
to look into the heavens, and
said with rapture:</p>

<p>"Come, Lord, and judge me;
for Thou knowest me altogether.
Come, Son of man; in Thee have
I trusted; let me never be confounded.
Oh, for the judgment-seat
of Christ!"</p>

<p>Again I stood in a brilliant
room, full of luxuries. Three or
four fair women were standing
pensively talking with each other.
Their apartment was bestrewn
with jewelry, laces, silks, velvets,
and every fanciful elegance of
fashion; but they looked troubled.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"This seems to me really awful,"
said one, with a suppressed
sigh. "What troubles me is, I
know so little about it."</p>

<p>"Yes," said another, "and it
puts a stop to everything! Of what
use will all these be to-morrow?"</p>

<p>There was a poor seamstress
in the corner of the room, who
now spoke. "We shall be ever
with the Lord," she said.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know what
that can mean," said the first
speaker, with a kind of shudder;
"it seems rather fearful."</p>

<p>"Well," said the other, "it
seems so sudden&mdash;when one
never dreamed of any such thing&mdash;to
change all at once from
this to that other life."</p>

<p>"It is enough to <i>be with Him</i>,"
said the poor woman. "Oh, I
have so longed for it!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>The great gulf</i>," again said the
angel.</p>

<p>Then again we stood on the
steps of a church. A band of clergymen
were together. Episcopalian,
Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian,
Old School and New
School, all stood hand in hand.</p>

<p>"It's no matter now about
these old issues," they said. "<i>He</i>
is coming; He will settle all.
Ordinations and ordinances, sacraments,
creeds, are but the scaffolding
of the edifice. They are
the shadow; the substance is
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>!" And hand in hand
they turned their faces when the
Christmas morning light began
faintly glowing; and I heard them
saying together, with one heart
and voice:</p>

<p>"Come, <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>! come
quickly!"</p>
